# Wine Quality Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical attributes. The project utilizes various machine learning models to classify wine quality, providing insights into the factors that contribute to higher quality wine.

# Project Overview
Wine quality is a subjective measure influenced by several chemical properties. This project leverages machine learning to predict wine quality scores based on features such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol concentration. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help winemakers and consumers assess wine quality more objectively.
